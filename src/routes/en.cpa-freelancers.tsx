  { q: "When should I register as osek patur vs. osek murshe?", a: "Osek patur (VAT-exempt dealer) is available under an annual revenue threshold updated yearly by the ITA. Above the threshold — or if your clients need VAT invoices — you must register as osek murshe. We assess the right fit at setup." },
  { q: "Sole proprietor or private company — what's better?", a: "It depends on income, expenses, savings and family situation. We run a personal simulation comparing after-tax cash — usually incorporation becomes attractive above a certain net profit range, but always subject to Pocket Company (חברת ארנק) risk analysis." },
  { q: "What is a capital declaration (הצהרת הון)?", a: "The ITA periodically requires self-employed individuals to file a personal statement of assets and liabilities. Differences between statements are treated as taxable income unless explained. We prepare and defend it." },
  { q: "I work with clients abroad — how do I invoice?", a: "An Israeli self-employed invoicing a foreign client applies 0% VAT under Section 30(a)(5) — no VAT charged, but input VAT is still recoverable. Invoices in English, currency conversion at the correct rate, and W-8BEN handling for US clients are all part of the setup we manage." },
  { q: "What is a Pocket Company (חברת ארנק) and how do I avoid the trap?", a: "Section 62A of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance targets one-person companies used to shelter what is effectively employment income. Classification as a Pocket Company eliminates the corporate tax benefit and applies effective tax of ~48%. We structure incorporation to prove genuine business substance — multiple clients, business risk, real investment." },
