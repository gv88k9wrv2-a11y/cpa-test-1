  { q: "Which accounting software do you support?", a: "We work across all leading Israeli and international cloud accounting platforms — from lightweight tools for freelancers to ERP systems for mid-market and multinational groups. We choose the right platform per client and manage the full setup, chart of accounts and integrations." },
  { q: "Can you take over from an existing bookkeeper?", a: "Yes. We handle a clean migration: opening balances, historical reconciliations, VAT alignment and full handover from the previous provider — usually within 2–4 weeks." },
  { q: "Do you handle VAT and withholding tax reporting?", a: "Full monthly / bi-monthly VAT (Form 874), withholding tax on service providers (Form 856), employer reports and year-end reconciliations." },
