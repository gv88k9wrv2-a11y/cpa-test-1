const FAQS = [
  { q: "When does a startup need a CPA?", a: "Before incorporation. Choosing the right structure (Israeli Ltd / Delaware C-Corp / dual-entity), founders' equity, vesting mechanics and 83(b) elections all affect the eventual tax outcome and fundraising trajectory." },
  { q: "Do you support fundraising rounds?", a: "Yes — from Pre-Seed to Series C and beyond. We prepare the data room, build the financial model, coordinate with counsel on SAFEs / CLAs / priced rounds, and structure the round for tax efficiency." },
  { q: "Can you handle an Israel–Delaware Flip?", a: "Yes — this is a core practice. We manage the Israeli side end-to-end: Pre-Ruling with the ITA for tax-deferred share exchange, coordination with US counsel, and post-flip Transfer Pricing between the Delaware C-Corp parent and the Israeli R&D subsidiary." },
  { q: "What is Section 102 (Equity & ESOP Incentive Plans) and how does it work?", a: "Tax and compliance support for employee equity compensation and option plans, including the assessment of relevant Section 102 routes, subject to the applicable conditions and circumstances. We prepare and file the plan, work with the trustee, and support employees at exercise and sale." },
  { q: "What is the Preferred Technological Enterprise regime?", a: "Companies meeting R&D and revenue thresholds under the Capital Investments Encouragement Law enjoy corporate tax of 12% (or 6% for a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise), vs. the standard 23%. We check eligibility, file with the ITA and defend on audit." },
  { q: "What is a 409A Valuation and why does it matter?", a: "If your company is a Delaware C-Corp or planning a US round, you need a fair-market-value assessment of the common stock under IRC §409A — required on every option grant, after every material event, and at least every 12 months. Wrong valuation exposes employees and the company to a 20% IRS penalty plus interest." },
  { q: "How should we build the Cap Table for investors?", a: "Investors scrutinize the cap table. We build it in Carta, Pulley or Ledgy, keep it fully diluted (including SAFEs, CLAs and Option Pool), and run dilution simulations of future rounds so founders understand the impact before signing." },
  { q: "What is a Secondary Transaction and what are the tax risks?", a: "A Secondary is a sale of founder or employee shares to an existing or new investor — an opportunity for early liquidity. The main risk is misclassification, which can materially affect the effective tax rate; proper structuring and, where relevant, an advance tax ruling can help mitigate this." },
