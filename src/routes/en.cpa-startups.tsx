const FAQS = [
  { q: "When does a startup need a CPA?", a: "Before incorporation. Choosing the right structure (Israeli Ltd / Delaware C-Corp / dual-entity), founders' equity, vesting mechanics and 83(b) elections all affect the eventual tax outcome and fundraising trajectory." },
  { q: "Do you support fundraising rounds?", a: "Yes — from Pre-Seed to Series C and beyond. We prepare the data room, build the financial model, coordinate with counsel on SAFEs / CLAs / priced rounds, and structure the round for tax efficiency." },
  { q: "Can you handle an Israel–Delaware Flip?", a: "Yes — this is a core practice. We manage the Israeli side end-to-end: Pre-Ruling with the ITA for tax-deferred share exchange, coordination with US counsel, and post-flip Transfer Pricing between the Delaware C-Corp parent and the Israeli R&D subsidiary." },
  { q: "What is Section 102 and how does it work?", a: "Section 102 lets Israeli companies grant equity to employees under the capital gains track (25% tax) via a trustee. We prepare and file the plan, appoint and work with the trustee, and support employees at exercise and sale." },
  { q: "What is the Preferred Technological Enterprise regime?", a: "Companies meeting R&D and revenue thresholds under the Capital Investments Encouragement Law enjoy corporate tax of 12% (or 6% for a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise), vs. the standard 23%. We check eligibility, file with the ITA and defend on audit." },
  { q: "What is a 409A Valuation and why does it matter?", a: "If your company is a Delaware C-Corp or planning a US round, you need a fair-market-value assessment of the common stock under IRC §409A — required on every option grant, after every material event, and at least every 12 months. Wrong valuation exposes employees and the company to a 20% IRS penalty plus interest." },
  { q: "How should we build the Cap Table for investors?", a: "Investors scrutinize the cap table. We build it in Carta, Pulley or Ledgy, keep it fully diluted (including SAFEs, CLAs and Option Pool), and run dilution simulations of future rounds so founders understand the impact before signing." },
  { q: "What is a Secondary Transaction and what are the tax risks?", a: "A Secondary is a sale of founder or employee shares to an existing or new investor — an opportunity for early liquidity. The main risk is misclassification: a Section 102 capital-gains gain (25%) can be reclassified as employment income (up to 50%) without proper structuring. We advise on route, escrow, clawback and Pre-Rulings." },
