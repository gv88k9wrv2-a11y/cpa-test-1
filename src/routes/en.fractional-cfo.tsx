  {
    q: "What is a Fractional CFO and who is it for?",
    a: "A Fractional CFO is a senior Chief Financial Officer engaged on a part-time basis (one day per week, several days per month) instead of the cost of a full-time hire. It is the right model for Seed–Series B startups, foreign companies operating in Israel that need a senior local finance presence, and growth-stage businesses that do not yet justify a full-time CFO. You get the experience of hundreds of funding rounds and board meetings — at a fraction of the cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is a Fractional CFO different from a bookkeeper?",
    a: "Bookkeeping is the historical record of what already happened. A Fractional CFO looks forward: builds the financial model, manages cash and Runway, prepares investor decks, sits in the boardroom, runs the Data Room and represents the company in front of VCs. The two functions are complementary — we deliver both under one roof with a clean information handoff between them.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are Burn Rate and Runway calculated, and why does it matter?",
    a: "Burn Rate (gross/net) is monthly cash consumption. Runway is the number of months until cash runs out — basic formula: Cash Balance ÷ Net Burn. In practice the CFO builds scenarios (Base/Bull/Bear), factors in Deferred Revenue, debt facilities and credit lines, and identifies the Trigger Points that force a decision: cut, raise, or accelerate. Rule of thumb — start fundraising while at least 9–12 months of Runway remain.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you actually attend investor pitches?",
    a: "Yes. We sit in VC meetings alongside the founders, answer complex financial questions, defend the model's assumptions and navigate the financial portion of the pitch. Support includes pre-meeting dry runs, coaching on financial terminology, and live response to investor challenges around Unit Economics, LTV/CAC, Rule of 40 and Gross Margin.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a Data Room and Ongoing DD include?",
    a: "A professional Data Room includes: audited financial statements for two prior years, fully-diluted Cap Table on Carta/Pulley, founders' agreements with vesting, approved Section 102 (Equity & ESOP Incentive Plans) plan, key customer contracts, key employee agreements, Transfer Pricing policy, tax and VAT clearances, insurance policies and authority correspondence. Ongoing DD means the room is always current and ready — so when an offer arrives, you enter negotiations in days, not months.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which KPIs do you track for the Board?",
    a: "For SaaS: MRR/ARR, Net Revenue Retention, Gross Margin, CAC Payback, LTV/CAC, Magic Number, Rule of 40. For commerce: Contribution Margin, Repeat Rate, AOV, Inventory Turnover. Cross-sector: Cash Balance, Burn, Runway, Headcount and Budget-vs-Actual. We build a monthly Dashboard with variance analysis and recommended actions, delivered to the board and investors on a fixed cadence.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a Fractional CFO cost?",
    a: "Pricing is flexible and scope-dependent: fixed monthly Retainer (one day per week / two days per month), project-based (fundraise prep, DD readiness, model build), or a mix. Key advantage — you only pay for the senior layer, while the professional team beneath (bookkeeping, payroll, audit) operates at standard cost. Saves 60–75% versus a full-time CFO in Israel.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should a company move to a full-time CFO?",
    a: "Usually after Series B, when ARR crosses $10M, headcount is 50+, operations span multiple countries and the board includes institutional investors. We manage the transition: define the role, run the search, and continue to advise the incoming CFO as external consultants during the handover to preserve continuity.",
