const FAQS = [
  { q: "Subsidiary or branch — which is better?", a: "Each has pros and cons. An Israeli subsidiary (Ltd) is a separate legal entity with limited liability and 23% corporate tax. A branch is an extension of the foreign parent — simpler to set up but exposes the parent. Choice depends on activity scale, home-country tax and treaties." },
  { q: "How long does it take to set up an Israeli subsidiary?", a: "Registration itself takes 3–5 business days. Bank account opening for a foreign-owned entity can take 4–8 weeks due to KYC. We manage the entire process." },
  { q: "Do you handle Israeli banking regulation?", a: "Yes. Bringing funds into Israel, FX conversion and account opening for foreign entities require expertise in AML/KYC rules. We represent clients with the banks and prepare all documentation." },
  { q: "What is Transfer Pricing and why does it matter?", a: "Transfer Pricing is the pricing of intra-group transactions between the foreign parent and Israeli subsidiary. Israeli law requires arm's length pricing. A professional TP study is mandatory above a threshold and protects against future ITA assessments." },
