  { q: "Do you audit under IFRS and US GAAP?", a: "Yes. Our engagements cover Israeli GAAP, IFRS and — via our international correspondents — US GAAP conversions for parent-company consolidation." },
  { q: "How long does a statutory audit take?", a: "For a typical small-medium company, 4–8 weeks depending on preparedness of the books. We provide a preparation checklist to shorten the timeline significantly." },
  { q: "Can you support due diligence for M&A / fundraising?", a: "Yes — we run buy-side or sell-side DD, prepare data rooms, quality-of-earnings analyses and normalized EBITDA schedules." },
